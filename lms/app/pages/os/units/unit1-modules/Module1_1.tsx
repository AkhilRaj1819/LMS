        <p>Hey Everyone!</p>

        <p>
          Imagine walking into an airport. Flights are landing and taking off every minute, luggage is being sorted,
          passengers are checking in, and air traffic controllers are coordinating hundreds of movements at once.
          Everything happens according to a system — organized, timed, and managed carefully so nothing collides or gets lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, think of your computer working in the same way. Every app you open, every file you save, every click you make
          - all of it relies on a hidden manager that keeps everything running smoothly. This invisible force is what we
          call the Operating System.

          This lesson is your Course Overview. It will give you a clear picture of what you’ll learn throughout the
          Operating Systems course and how each part connects to the next.
        </p>

        <p>Let's get started.</p>

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

        <p>By the end of this course, you’ll be fully equipped to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Understand and explain core operating system concepts like process management, memory allocation, and file systems.</li>
          <li>Analyze and troubleshoot real-world OS-level problems, including deadlocks, scheduling issues, and resource contention.</li>
          <li>Design and evaluate efficient CPU scheduling and memory management strategies for different use cases.</li>
          <li>Apply operating system principles in areas like systems programming, performance tuning, and interview preparation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          💡 Recruiters and hiring managers don’t just assess what you know about operating systems, but how well you can
          apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios. This course helps you build a systems-thinking mindset focused on
          clarity, efficiency, and precision.
        </p>

        <h3>Why This Course?</h3>

        <p>
          Unlike generic OS tutorials, this course is structured for depth, clarity, and practical impact. It's crafted
          to bridge academic foundations with real-world applications. You won’t just learn how an OS works—you’ll learn
          to explain, optimize, and apply its concepts in interviews, projects, and system-level problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>This is more than just an Operating Systems course:</p>

        <h3>Structured Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>Carefully crafted to help you understand not just what an OS does, but why it matters.</p>

        <h3>Conceptual Progression</h3>
        <p>Each module builds on the previous—ensuring clarity without overwhelming jumps.</p>

        <h3>Diverse Assessments</h3>
        <p>From MCQs and diagram questions to hands-on activities and code walkthroughs—designed for well-rounded mastery.</p>

        <h3>Practical Relevance</h3>
        <p>Concepts are tied to real-world systems, troubleshooting cases, and industry-aligned OS scenarios.</p>

        <h3>What’s Expected From You</h3>

        <p>
          This course covers all the essential OS concepts and graded activities, but to truly internalize the subject,
          you’ll need to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Work through the additional practice questions provided after each major topic.</li>
          <li>Revisit core explanations and live sessions with a system-level problem-solving mindset.</li>
          <li>Dive into the system scenario-based assessments that reflect real-world and interview-level OS challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>📌 Note: There’s no shortcut to mastery. Practice + Conceptual Clarity is the key!</p>
